    "Many other approaches are available for creating plots in R. In fact, the plotting capabilities that come with a basic installation of R are already quite powerful. There are also other packages for creating graphics such as __grid__ and __lattice__. We chose to use __ggplot2__ in this book because it breaks plots into components in a way that permits beginners to create relatively complex and aesthetically pleasing plots using syntax that is intuitive and comparatively easy to remember. \n",
    "\n",
    "One reason __ggplot2__ is generally more intuitive for beginners is that it uses a grammar of graphics^[http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447], the _gg_ in __ggplot2__. This is analogous to the way learning grammar can help a beginner construct hundreds of different sentences by learning just a handful of verbs, nouns and adjectives without having to memorize each specific sentence. Similarly, by learning a handful of __ggplot2__ building blocks and its grammar, you will be able to create hundreds of different plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason __ggplot2__ is easy for beginners is that its default behavior is carefully chosen to satisfy the great majority of cases and is visually pleasing. As a result, it is possible to create informative and elegant graphs with relatively simple and readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation is that __ggplot2__ is designed to work exclusively with data tables in tidy format (where rows are observations and columns are variables). However, a substantial percentage of datasets that beginners work with are in, or can be converted into, this format. An advantage of this approach is that, assuming that our data is tidy, __ggplot2__ simplifies plotting code and the learning of grammar for a variety of plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use __ggplot2__  you will have to learn several functions and arguments. These are hard to memorize, so we highly recommend you have the ggplot2 cheat sheet  handy.

Each point represents a different observation, and we _map_ data about these observations to visual cues like x- and y-scale. Color is another visual cue that we map to region.
